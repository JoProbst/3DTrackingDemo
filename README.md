# Code used for Bachelor Thesis
 
The code used for my bachelor thesis is available on this page. 
The example input and output are available for one set of artificially created videos rendered using blender and include the ground truth Morphable Model coefficients and the transformation matrices for each frame.
The output of the tracking for the example videos can be found in the folder implementations/outBaseline/blender.
The results of the 2D and 3D fitting methods are in the different respective directories under implementations.
They can be run on the output found in implementations/outBaseline/blender.
To run the tracking, a version of the 4DFace SDK is needed, which contains the face and landmark detectors.
